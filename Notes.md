"Nasreen Mohamedi"
"One of the most significant artists to emerge in post-Independence India, Nasreen Mohamedi (1937â€“1990) created a body of work that demonstrates a singular and sustained engagement with abstraction. Her minimalist practice not only adds a rich layer to the history of South Asian art but also necessitates an expansion of the narratives of international modernism. The Met Breuer exhibition, the first museum retrospective of the artist's work in the United States, is an important part of the Met's initiative to explore and present the global scope of modern and contemporary art."
