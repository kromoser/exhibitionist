# Exhibitionist

The Exhibitionist is an easy way to see what art exhibtions are currently showing in NYC at a handful of major museums, all from the privacy of your terminal. It defaults to sorting current shows by how soon they're closing, so that you don't miss that show you've been meaning to see.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'exhibitionist'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install the-exhibitionist

## Usage

After installing, type 'exhibitionist' to start the program.

Follow the prompts to select which show you'd like to get more details about. Selecting an exhibition lists where it is located and when it's closing, as well as other shows you might want to see at the same museum. You can also view shows by instituion, if you're interested in going to a particular museum.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
